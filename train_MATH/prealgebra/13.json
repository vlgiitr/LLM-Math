    "problem": "Find $r$ if $3(r-7) = 4(2-2r) + 4$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Expanding both products gives \\[3r - 3\\cdot 7 = 4\\cdot 2 - 4\\cdot 2r + 4,\\] so $3r - 21 = 8 - 8r + 4$.  Simplifying the right-hand side gives $3r -21 = 12-8r$.  Adding $8r$ and 21 to both sides gives $11r = 33$, so $r=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "hint": "To solve the equation, distribute the constants on both sides, then combine like terms to isolate the variable 'r' on one side of the equation. Finally, solve for 'r' by dividing both sides by its coefficient. \n",
    "answer": "3"
