    "problem": "A cube with an edge length of 4 units has the same volume as a square-based pyramid with base edge lengths of 8 units and a height of $h$ units. What is the value of $h$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The cube has volume $4^3=64$.  The pyramid has volume $\\frac{1}{3}8^2h$.  So\n\n$$64=\\frac{64}{3}h\\Rightarrow h=\\boxed{3}$$",
    "hint": "To solve this problem, first calculate the volume of the cube. Then, set up an equation equating the volume of the cube to the volume of the pyramid. Finally, solve for the height (h) of the pyramid. \n",
    "ad_hint": "To solve this problem, first calculate the area of the square. Then, set up an equation equating the area of the square to the volume of the pyramid. Finally, solve for the height (h) of the pyramid. \n",
    "answer": "3"
