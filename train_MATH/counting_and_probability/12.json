    "problem": "What is the coefficient of $x^8$ in the expansion of $(x-1)^9$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By the Binomial Theorem applied to $(x+(-1))^9$, this term is $\\binom98x^8(-1)^1=-9x^8$.  The coefficient of this term is $\\boxed{-9}$.",
    "hint": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$, use the Binomial Theorem to expand the expression and identify the term containing $x^8$. Calculate the binomial coefficient and the coefficient of the remaining factor to determine the overall coefficient of $x^8$. \n",
    "ad_hint": "To find the coefficient of $x^8$, use the Binomial Theorem to expand the expression and identify the term containing $x^7$. Calculate the binomial coefficient and the coefficient of the remaining factor to determine the overall coefficient of $x^8$. \n",
    "answer": "-9"
