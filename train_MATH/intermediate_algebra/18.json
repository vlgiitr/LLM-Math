    "problem": "When a polynomial is divided by $2x^2 - 7x + 18,$ what are the possible degrees of the remainder?  Enter all the possible values, separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "In general, when a polynomial is divided by a polynomial of degree $d,$ then the possible degrees of the remainder are 0, 1, 2, $\\dots,$ $d - 1.$  Therefore, the possible degrees of the remainder here are $\\boxed{0,1}.$",
    "hint": "To find the possible degrees of the remainder, determine the degree of the divisor polynomial and subtract 1. The resulting numbers, starting from 0, represent the possible degrees of the remainder. \n",
    "answer": "0,1"
