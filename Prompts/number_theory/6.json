    "problem": "Find the remainder when the sum \\[75+76+77+78+79+80+81+82\\]is divided by 16.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We notice that 16 divides $78+82$ as well as $79+81$ and also 80.  Therefore the sum is congruent to  \\[75+76+77\\pmod{16}.\\]Since these numbers are congruent to $-5$, $-4$, and $-3$ modulo 16, this can be computed as  \\[-5-4-3\\equiv-12\\pmod{16}.\\]Finally, since $-12\\equiv4\\pmod{16}$ the remainder we seek is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "hint": "To solve this problem, group the numbers in the sum to create multiples of 16. Then, find the remainders of the remaining numbers when divided by 16 and add them up. Finally, find the remainder of this sum when divided by 16. \n",
