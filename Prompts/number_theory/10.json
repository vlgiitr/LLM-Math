    "problem": "If $AAA_4$ can be expressed as $33_b$, where $A$ is a digit in base 4 and $b$ is a base greater than 5, what is the smallest possible sum $A+b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can rewrite $AAA_4$ and $33_b$ to get \\begin{align*}\n16A+4A+A&=3b+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n21A&=3b+3.\n\\end{align*}The smallest possible value for $A$ is 1, which gives us $21=3b+3$ and $b=6$. So the smallest sum $A+b=\\boxed{7}$. While there are other values for $A$ and $b$ that work, increasing $A$ will increase $b$, resulting in a larger sum.",
    "hint": "To solve this problem, convert the numbers from their respective bases to base 10, set the expressions equal to each other, and then solve for the variables. The smallest possible sum is found by minimizing the value of $A$, as this will minimize the value of $b$. \n",
