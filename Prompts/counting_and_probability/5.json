    "problem": "John draws a regular five pointed star in the sand, and at each of the 5 outward-pointing points and 5 inward-pointing points he places one of ten different sea shells. How many ways can he place the shells, if reflections and rotations of an arrangement are considered equivalent?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $10!$ ways to put the shells in the sand, not considering rotations and reflections. Arrangements can be reflected or not reflected and can be rotated by 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, or 4/5, so they come in groups of ten equivalent arrangements. Correcting for the symmetries, we find that there are $10!/10=\\boxed{362880}$ distinct arrangements.",
    "hint": "To solve this problem, first calculate the total number of ways to arrange the shells without considering symmetry. Then, divide this number by the number of equivalent arrangements per unique configuration, which is the number of rotations and reflections that produce identical patterns. \n",
    "ad_hint": "To solve this problem, first calculate the total number of ways to arrange the shells without considering symmetry. Then, multiply this number by the number of equivalent arrangements per unique configuration, which is the number of rotations and refractions that produce identical patterns. \n",
