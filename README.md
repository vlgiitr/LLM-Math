# LLM Mathematical Ability Tester
This project evaluates the mathematical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and examines how providing hints in prompts affects their performance.
## Project Overview
This tool generates mathematical problems, presents them to LLMs with and without hints, and analyzes the responses to assess:

- The baseline mathematical ability of LLMs
- How hint-enhanced prompts impact the accuracy and approach of LLM solutions
