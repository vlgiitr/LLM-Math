    "problem": "Suppose $z$ is a complex number such that $z^2 = 156 + 65i.$  Find $|z|.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $z^2 = 156+65i$, we must have $|z^2| = |156+65i| = |13(12+5i)| = 13|12+5i| = 13(13) = 169$.  We also have $|z|^2 = |z|\\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)| = |z^2|$, so $|z^2| = 169$ means that $|z|^2 = 169$, which gives us $|z| = \\sqrt{169} = \\boxed{13}$.",
    "hint": "To find the modulus of a complex number, find the modulus of its square and then take the square root.  This works because the modulus of a product of complex numbers is the product of their moduli. \n",
    "answer": "13"
